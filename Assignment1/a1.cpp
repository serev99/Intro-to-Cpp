/* Question 3
(A) 
Q: Research tail recursivity and explain in your own words why it is better to design
your recursive function this way.

A: The tail recursive functions considered better than normal recursive functions as they can be
optimized by compiler with space and execution efficiency. Since recurisve call is always the last 
statement in tail recursion, there is nothing left to do in the current function, so saving the 
current function's stack frame is of no use. In other words, the calling function will never get a
chance to do anything after the call if this optimization is performed. However, in normal recursion,
the computer usually uses stack to remember the call locations.

(B)
Q: Can any recursive function be designed to be tail recursive? Please develop your
answer by providing clear explanation

A: By modifying the function in serveral ways, we can write any recursive function in a tail-recursive
way. While local modification is sufficient, as in the next questions, we can often add an 
"accumulator" that builds some expression that is returned. Alternatively, modifying globally the
entire program may help to rewrite the function in a tail-recursive way. Each function takes as an
extra argument the function that contains future actions, the method called continuation passing, 
helping to rewrite the function.
